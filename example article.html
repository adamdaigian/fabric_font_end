<p>When <a href="/category/apple/">Apple</a> announced the release of the fourth-generation iPad — often called the iPad 4, or iPad with Retina display — in October 2012, many consumers <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/10/23/ipad-3-owner-oped/">felt angered</a> by the rapid replacement of the very similar iPad 3 ("the new iPad"). Still, you only needed to decide whether or not to upgrade to the slightly more powerful device — and if you had recently dished out hundreds of dollars for the iPad 3, the decision wasn't very difficult. </p>
<p>But in the same announcement, Apple introduced the <a href="/category/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> — an arguably game-changing miniature tablet that made consumers rethink how and why to use their mobile devices. As a result, especially for people looking to buy their first tablets, the decision process became complicated.</p>
<p>We've prepared this guide to help you decide whether the latest iPad or iPad mini is right for you. Like all gadgets, it ultimately comes down to preference — that is, how you plan to use your tablet — but there are plenty of specs to help you choose.</p>
 Similarities 
<p>First, you should know what you'll get with both the iPad and the iPad mini. As far as capacity goes, you can purchase 16GB, 32GB and 64GB models of each tablet. Of course there are price differences, and you can upgrade to a 128GB model of the iPad, but standard memory is available on either one.</p>
<p>Although the iPad mini is smaller, it doesn't lack anything in camera capability. The iSight camera for both the iPad and iPad mini boasts 5-megapixel photos, autofocus, face detection, backside illumination, a five-elements lens, hybrid IR filter and ƒ/2.4 aperture. FaceTime HD allows for 1.2-megapixel photos, 720p HD video and works over Wi‑Fi and cellular services. Both the iPad and iPad mini record video in 1080p HD, allowing you to tap to focus while recording, and video stabilization.</p>
<p>Both devices are available with mobile carriers AT&amp;T, Sprint and Verizon, and have exactly the same wireless and cellular capabilities (including Bluetooth 4.0 technology). The iPad and iPad mini both allow for up to 10 hours of surfing the web on Wi‑Fi, watching video or listening to music (nine hours of surfing the web using cellular data). </p>
<p>Each device uses the <a href="/category/lightning/">Lightning</a> cable, and you can charge with a power adapter or connect to your computer. And don't worry — <a href="/category/siri/">Siri</a> is available to assist you no matter which iPad you purchase, as they each run the same version of iOS.</p>
<p>Lastly, both the iPad and iPad mini run every app in the App Store — however, because of screen size and power, the experience or performance may vary. </p>
 Display

<p>The biggest difference between these tablets is screen density. The iPad mini's display is 7.9 inches diagonally, with 1024 x 768 resolution at 163 pixels per inch. The iPad with Retina display packs a punch — 9.7 inches, with 2048 x 1536 resolution at 264 pixels per inch.</p>
<p>For regular use, the two-inch difference and crystal clear resolution don't affect <em>that</em> much, but there are definitely a few things to consider. If you're using your tablet primarily as a media player — watching movies, viewing or editing photos, etc. — the iPad Retina is typically going to be the better option. The reason is simple: You can see more. This is also better for productivity, as you have more room to navigate.</p>
<p>That said, the iPad mini displays media perfectly fine, and may be a better option if you're using it more on the go. It's also more akin to the screens of mobile gaming devices, whereas iPad Retina gameplay may prove an uncomfortable experience (both visually and physically).</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Apple is reportedly planning to release an <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/08/01/ipad-mini-retina/">iPad mini with Retina display</a> in late 2013, though this has not yet been confirmed.</p>
 Power and Speed 
<p>The iPad Retina, with its dual-core A6X processor and quad-core graphics, is undoubtedly stronger than the iPad mini, which has the standard dual-core A5 processor. In layman's terms, this means the iPad Retina has twice the processing power and four times the graphics power of the iPad mini.</p>
<p>This shouldn't be too surprising — the iPad mini is, after all, "mini." If power and speed are most important to you, the iPad Retina is the way to go.</p>
<p>Still, it's worth noting: The iPad mini possesses all of the iPad's capabilities. Owning an iPad mini means you're sacrificing screen size more than anything else.</p>
 Overall Size 
<p>The iPad mini is definitely easier to carry around, putting the "mobile" in mobile device. It easily fits into your purse or backpack pocket, and is also easy to use with one hand. At a depth of 0.28 inches, it's thinner than other iPads, and if the smaller screen ever bothers you, you can always connect it to a TV (though that kind of defeats the purpose).</p>
<p>These aspects bring up an interesting point. Some people have compared the iPad mini to a slightly larger iPhone, with all of the same capabilities except making calls. And when you think about it, the screen of <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/guide-to-galaxy-smart-devices/galaxy-note-2-smartphone.html">Samsung's Galaxy Note</a> smartphone is only approximately 2 inches smaller than the iPad mini's. The difference seems to be the iOS ecosystem — if you're looking for a small iPad, that's literally what you'll get with the iPad mini.</p>
<p>The iPad Retina is classically sized; the main difference is really the display, as mentioned above.</p>
 Price 
<p><img src="http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA4LzExL2Y5L2lwYWRtaW5pZ2FtLmUwOGE2LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTEyMDB4OTYwMD4/79390ee6/8ce/ipad-mini-game-kid.jpg">Image: Flickr, 5goldpieces Photography</p>
<p>For many consumers, the price differences will be the ultimate deciding factor. The iPad mini starts at $329 for the Wi‑Fi 16GB model, and goes up to $659 for 64GB (Wi-Fi <em>and</em> cellular).</p>
<p>The iPad with Retina display starts at $499 for the Wi‑Fi 16GB model, and goes up to $929 for 128GB (Wi-Fi and cellular).</p>
<p>You'll need to ask yourself: Is saving between $170 and $270 worth sacrificing some power and resolution? In many cases, it may be, but again, it depends how you plan to use your iPad.</p>
<p>In the end, the iPad mini is for those Apple customers who already know and understand the iOS ecosystem (or who are looking for an introduction to it), but always thought the iPad was too large and expensive. The iPad with Retina display is for those consumers looking to upgrade their tablet experience — those who want the best tablet display size and resolution available on the market.</p>
 A Third Option 
<p>While Apple has discontinued the third-generation iPad, you can still purchase the iPad 2. Some critics argue that the iPad 2 is a slower and less powerful tablet than other available options — and they're correct — but it still helps you complete standard tasks.</p>
<p>It has the same dual-core A5 processor as the iPad mini, but it is only available in a 16GB model. It's slightly thinner and lighter than the iPad with Retina display, and has much lower camera capabilities than the iPad mini and iPad Retina.</p>
<p>The iPad 2's price tag is appealing: $399 for the Wi-Fi model, and $529 for Wi-Fi and 3G. The iPad 2 is essentially for consumers looking to get a standard iPad with the classic size, without breaking the bank.</p>
